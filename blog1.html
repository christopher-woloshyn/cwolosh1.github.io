          <p>
            Sometimes it's nice to curate a space for yourself to share thoughts and ideas.
            Writing down ideas is the first step in forming a larger set of ideas and concepts to share with others,
            and I feel like a blog built into this website will force me to apply some polish to the rudimentary ideas I need to write down.</p>
          <p>
            However, it's hard to decide whether or not this blog should be kept as something professional and formal,
            or if I should take the liberty to discuss other topics that interest me.
            Professionals urge that anything presented outside the scope of my career interests would take away from my efforts to present my qualifications, though.
            But I don't care.</p>
          <p>
            I enjoy many different hobbies, and I think it could be fun to explore them here.
            In the future, I could see myself making professional posts about Data Science,
            or hobbiest posts about Fitness, Painting, Dungeons and Dragons, or something in the world of cinema.
            Whatever it may be, it will be totally unorganized,
            and just presented on the "Blog Contents" page in reverse chronological order!</p>
          <p>
            So there it is.
            My first blog post done and dusted.
            I don't plan on doing this too often,
            but it will be nice to post something every so often to give this website a little more content to look through.</p>
